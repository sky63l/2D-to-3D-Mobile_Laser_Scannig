# 2D-to-3D-Mobile_Laser_Scannig

This repository is presented the development of a prototype system on a ROS (Robot Operating System) package for 3D mapping using a low-cost 2D LiDAR sensor. The software and hardware architecture was validated to implement a 3D model construction algorithm based on displacement mapping obtained from odometry data from mobile robots.


## Usage
For clone just run below command at terminal  
```
