# ROS_compatible_package_for_3D_reconstruction_using_a_Low-cost_LiDAR-2D
The development of a prototype system on a ROS (Robot Operating System) package for 3D mapping using a low-cost 2D LiDAR sensor is presented. The software and hardware architecture was validated to implement a 3D model construction algorithm based on displacement mapping obtained from odometry data from mobile robots.
